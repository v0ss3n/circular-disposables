            <h2>Masks</h2>
            <p>We have done quite a few iterations to decide what mask design would suit our concept best and would be
                the most comfortable to wear. We tried out a variety of fabrics: from thin polyester to thick cotton and
                some other materials in between.
            </p>

                <img src="./img/fabr4.gif" alt="">
            </div>

            <p>We ended up prefering a circular shaped design, since it was quite comfortable to wear with glasses (we
                both wear them and know the struggle) and it suited our concept best: the circular shape refers to the
                shapes of the planets so we could use a full planet print as a basis for each mask. </p>

            <p>Erika tried some of the masks designs and documented this in the video below.</p>

        <div class="content__element" id="pouches">

            <h2>Pouches</h2>
            <p>The idea from the pouches started with this series of paper pouches that we folded from basic A4 paper.
                Here the main idea was that anyone could fold themselves a quick nice mask pouch. After discussing our
                progress with Ingeborg however, she advised us that we have to take into consideration that people are
                less worried about littering if a material is considered cheap. We also considered biodegradable
                materials to make our product more circular, but it’s not always better if you need something long
                lasting. We learned that in the Netherlands we don’t have the systems in place for degradable materials
                like banana leaves.
            </p>
            <img src="./img/pp.png" alt="Paper pouches">

            <p>For our second iteration we decided to continue with fabric, both because this is the material Michelle is most
                familiar with as a fashion designer, and because we felt it would give a more appealing feel to the
                pouches, so people wouldn’t want to throw them away. We also needed a way to distinguish between the
                different pouches for the different days, so before we came up with the planetary concept, we tried some
                colorful gradients. Michelle used the sublimation printer at her work to print on polyester fabric.

                <img src="./img/cp1.png" alt="">
            </div>

            <p>For our final iteration we used the planetary concept as shown on the main project page. We also did a
                styling session to try out different ways of wearing the pouches. If we were to commercialize the
                pouches, it would probably be best to pick one design that can be worn in multiple ways, and distinguish
                them with the prints. The video below shows the process.</p>
